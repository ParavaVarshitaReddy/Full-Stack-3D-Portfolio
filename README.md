# Full Stack 3D Portfolio Website

This is a full-stack portfolio website that showcases 3D models with **React**, **Three.js**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. It features a **responsive design** using **Tailwind CSS** and integrates **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** via **GitHub Actions**. The app displays an interactive 3D model that users can view and interact with directly in the browser.

## Features

- **3D Model Showcase**: Display and interact with 3D models in real-time using **Three.js**.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with **Tailwind CSS** to ensure the website looks great on any screen size.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates deployment with **GitHub Actions**.
- **Server-side**: Uses **Node.js** and **Express.js** for the backend and to handle requests.
- **Database Integration**: Built to easily integrate with **MongoDB** for storing data (if needed).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **React** for dynamic rendering of the 3D models.
  - **Three.js** to load and display 3D models.
  - **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
  
- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js** and **Express.js** to build the API and server.
  - **MongoDB** (optional) for database storage.

- **CI/CD**:
  - **GitHub Actions** for automating deployment to Vercel.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### 1. Clone this repository
Clone the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-portfolio.git
cd 3d-portfolio
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Client-side (Frontend)
Navigate to the `client` folder and install the frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

#### Server-side (Backend)
Navigate to the `server` folder and install the backend dependencies:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
For the backend, create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with your MongoDB connection string (if you're using MongoDB):

```bash
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
```

### 4. Running the Application Locally

#### Start the Client
In the `client` directory, run the following command to start the React frontend:
```bash
npm start
```

#### Start the Server
In the `server` directory, run the following command to start the backend:
```bash
npm start
```

This will start both the client and server, and you can access your portfolio website on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 5. Deploying the Application
This application uses **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD. When you push to the `main` branch, it will automatically deploy the frontend to **Vercel** and set up any backend integrations.

To deploy manually (optional), make sure you have **Vercel** and **GitHub Actions** properly set up to deploy both the frontend and backend.

## How to Add a New 3D Model

1. **Download a 3D model** in `.glb` format from websites like [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/tags/free), [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/), or [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/).
2. Place your model file in the `client/public/models/` directory.
3. Update the path to the model in the `client/src/components/3DModel.js` file if needed:
   ```javascript
   const modelPath = "/models/yourModel.glb";
   ```
